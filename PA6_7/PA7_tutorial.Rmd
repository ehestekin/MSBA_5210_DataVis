### Intro
This tutorial will show the basics of the patchwork package.  A simple and powerful alternative to the familiar grid.arrange() style plot organization.  First install the package if it isn't already installed.

```{r}
#this syntax will check if package is already downloaded to save some time
if(!('patchwork' %in% installed.packages())){
  install.packages('patchwork')
}
```


We are going to use the King County housing data for this example.

```{r}
housing_data <- read.csv('qp1_data.csv')
```
